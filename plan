Subproblems:
1. Read and parse the room setup file.

3. Implement functions for each command: move, pick up an object, drop an object, and use an object for a hint.
4. Track the player's actions, score (number of moves), and inventory.

Test Plan:
1. Read and parse the room setup file:
   - Create a test file with room setup information, including names, items, room descriptions, text instructions, directions to other rooms, and hints.
   - Verify that the file is successfully read and parsed, and the information is stored correctly in the data structure.

2. Initialize the data structure:
   - Ensure that the data structure is correctly initialized with the room information.
   - Verify that all the necessary information is stored for each room.

3. Implement move command:
   - Test moving north, south, east, and west from different rooms.
   - Verify that the player's current room is updated correctly after each move.
   - Ensure that the player cannot move in invalid directions.

4. Implement pick up command:
   - Test picking up an object from a room.
   - Verify that the player's inventory is updated correctly.
   - Ensure that the player's wallet is updated with the appropriate amount.

5. Implement drop command:
   - Test dropping an object from the player's inventory.
   - Verify that the player's inventory is updated correctly.
   - Ensure that the player's wallet is updated with the appropriate amount.

6. Implement use command for a hint:
   - Test using an object for a hint.
   - Verify that the hint is displayed if the object is the correct one.
   - Ensure that the player's inventory is not updated after using an object for a hint.

7. Track player's actions and score:
   - Verify that the player's actions (moves) are counted correctly.
   - Ensure that the score is updated accordingly after each move.

8. Test game termination:
   - Test reaching the escape room.
   - Verify that the game ends when the player reaches the escape room.
   - Test stopping the game at any point and verify that it ends.

9. Advanced: Load player configuration and update details:
   - Create a player configuration file with name, details, and wallet information.
   - Ensure that the player's configuration is loaded correctly at the start of the game.
   - Test updating the player's details, including the wallet, after picking up and dropping objects.
   - Verify that the updated player details are correctly written back to the configuration file at the end of the game.
